# flare-cmd

Open project in QtCreator, build, and add Command line to Tiled:

```
flare-cmd -map %mapfile -type %objecttype
```

Edit `flare-dialog-template.txt` to change the default dialog template and save it next to `flare-cmd`.
  
Select the NPC you want to edit on map and click on Command. It should open the dialog file for the NPC in your env text editor,
or if the NPC dialog file does not exist it copies `flare-dialog-template.txt` to the type location and open it.
